- 👋 Hi, I’m @Duma107  
- 👀 I’m passionate about combining virtual assistance and software development to create innovative real-time solutions.  
- 🌱 I’m currently advancing my skills in front-end development as part of the CodeSpace Academy program while integrating project management from the ALX Virtual Assistant Fellowship. I'm also exploring the endless possibilities of Linux Ubuntu for both development and virtual assistance.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web designs, beginner-friendly coding projects, open-source contributions, and projects that merge virtual assistance with software development for enhanced productivity.
